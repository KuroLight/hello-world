# hello-world


Hello, everyone!

My name is KuroLight. I am starting to learn programming, hoping to be a proficient developer in the near future.
I know it's not easy a road, so it is bound to take me tons of time, maybe years, and efforts to become an expert in CS.

Thanks to all you guys' support. I will try my best.
